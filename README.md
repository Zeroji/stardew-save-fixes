Stardew Save Fixes
==================

*Fixes and tweaks for Stardew Valley game saves.*

[View web app on github.io][pages]

What is this?
-------------

It's a simple web page which can edit your Stardew Valley save files to fix bugs,
or to edit some stuff (more options to come!)

How to use
----------

Head to the [web app][pages], grab your Stardew Valley save files and select it!
You'll need either the one named `SaveGameInfo`, or something like `FarmName_123456789`.
Depending on which operation you want, you may need both - I haven't done too much
research into this, to be honest.

Note that no data is ever uploaded anywhere, the files stay in your browser the whole time.
*(That also means you could use it offline, assuming you have the page loaded.)*

After loading your save, an interface will pop up with several tabs (well, currently, one) for
the different fixes. Pick what you need and how to use it should be self-explanatory.

When you're finished, click the download button at the bottom to grab your modified save file.
You will need to save it in the same directory, overwriting the existing one.

> **Warning:** there are no guarantees here, backup your save files if you're worried!
